# The free Web Developer Roadmap for 2023 

## ðŸ†•Â Introduction

Becoming a web developer today can be a hard journey. Online there are tons of videos, books, and courses. This can cause analysis paralysis. Also, as a new developer, you can literally learn tens of different languages. There are a few reasons why I decided to create this repository:

- Let you avoid common mistakes
- Provide a free study path accessible to everyone
- Connect the dots between the technologies
- Help you learn tech in the correct way

## ðŸ§ Â Assumptions

Unfortunately, in computer science, there is no solution that fits all the requirements. I have to make a few assumptions about you to give you a useful path.

My assumptions are: 

- You are passionate about computer science and you want to learn more
- Your English level is enough to understand videos, books, and articles
- You donâ€™t have past working experience in this field
- All the listed resources are free
- You have basics tech skills, like using a computer, installing software, and using the web

## ðŸ“šÂ How to use this guide

As youâ€™ll see in the next section, I divided the study into multiple weeks. I assume a daily study of 5h/day, 6 days/week (30hrs/week). If you canâ€™t afford this rhythm (which is totally fine), just keep in mind that this is not a race, you can take your time.

Youâ€™ll find a few checkboxes, feel free to copy this document (or fork it as we will see later) and check the checkbox as soon as you finish an activity. 

Youâ€™ll find activities related to hard and soft skills. Being a good developer is not about writing code. 

Ready? Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€



## Time to study

### ðŸ”¨Â Week 1 - Introduction & Tools

#### Week description

In this first week, weâ€™ll make a basic introduction to programming and how the Internet works. Then we will learn the basics of VSCode (a text editor used to write software) and Git (a tool used to version our code). Also, we will create a basic Linkedin profile to reach out to other developers and grow our network.

#### Why it matters

Starting with a basic computer science and Internet understanding is fundamental in a Web Development roadmap

In the first week, you need to setup your tools. You need: 

- A computer
- A good internet connection (youâ€™ll see a lot of videos)

The first weeks are the most complex, youâ€™re going to receive a lot of information, youâ€™ll find weird names and you need to manage multiple complex concepts. Feel free to rewatch a video multiple times if you donâ€™t understand it correctly.
