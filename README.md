# The free Web Developer Roadmap for 2023 

## ðŸ†•Â Introduction

Becoming a web developer today can be a hard journey. Online there are tons of videos, books, and courses. This can cause analysis paralysis. Also, as a new developer, you can literally learn tens of different languages. There are a few reasons why I decided to create this repository:

- Let you avoid common mistakes
- Provide a free study path accessible to everyone
- Connect the dots between the technologies
- Help you learn tech in the correct way

## ðŸ§ Â Assumptions

Unfortunately, in computer science, there is no solution that fits all the requirements. I have to make a few assumptions about you to give you a useful path.

My assumptions are: 

- You are passionate about computer science and you want to learn more
- Your English level is enough to understand videos, books, and articles
- You donâ€™t have past working experience in this field
- All the listed resources are free
- You have basics tech skills, like using a computer, installing software, and using the web

## ðŸ“šÂ How to use this guide

As youâ€™ll see in the next section, I divided the study into multiple weeks. I assume a daily study of 5h/day, 6 days/week (30hrs/week). If you canâ€™t afford this rhythm (which is totally fine), just keep in mind that this is not a race, you can take your time.

Youâ€™ll find a few checkboxes, feel free to copy this document (or fork it as we will see later) and check the checkbox as soon as you finish an activity. 

Youâ€™ll find activities related to hard and soft skills. Being a good developer is not about writing code. 

Ready? Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€
